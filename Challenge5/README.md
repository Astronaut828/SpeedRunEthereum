# 🚩 Challenge 5: 📺 A State Channel Application

🐌 The Ethereum blockchain has great decentralization & security properties. These properties come at a price: transaction throughput is low, and transactions can be expensive (search term: blockchain trilemma). This makes many traditional web applications infeasible on a blockchain... or does it?

🍰 A number of approaches to scaling have been developed, collectively referred to as layer-2s (L2s). Among them is the concept of payment channels, state channels, and state channel networks. This tutorial walks through the creation of a simple state channel application, where users seeking a service **lock** collateral on-chain with a single transaction, **interact** with their service provider entirely off-chain, and **finalize** the interaction with a second on-chain transaction.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 State channels really excel as a scaling solution in cases where a fixed set of participants want to exchange value-for-service at high frequency. The canonical example is in file sharing or media streaming: the server exchanges chunks of a file in exchange for micropayments.

🧙 In our case, the service provider is a `Guru` who provides off-the-cuff wisdom to each client `Rube` through a one-way chat box. Each character of text that is delivered is expected to be compensated with a payment of `0.01 ETH`.
