# üö© Challenge 4: ‚öñÔ∏è Build a DEX


This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the [original tutorial](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90) and challenge repos before it. Please read the intro for a background on what we are building first!

üåü The final deliverable is an app that allows users to seamlessly trade ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) with ETH in a decentralized manner. Users will be able to connect their wallets, view their token balances, and buy or sell their tokens according to a price formula!
Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

There is also a üé• [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP5w6Ger1EQ) that may help you understand the concepts covered within this challenge too:
