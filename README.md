Week 4 - 🚢 Build Your Own Project<br>
<br>
<br>
Week 1 - 👩‍🔬 Becoming A Power User

The first step to starting as a developer in the web3 ecosystem is first to become a Power User!

You should start by getting hands-on & using the tools which will give you a much greater understanding of what you can do and what the crypto space is all about. In this section, we're talking about the tools in the crypto space, using them and helping you become an Ethereum power user.


<br>
Week 2 - 👩‍🚀 Scripting and Smart Contracts

In this section, we'll start programming!

It goes from writing scripts, talking to the blockchain, and building Decentralized Applications(dApps). The topics covered included Providers, Signers, ethers.js, hardhat, scaffold-eth and many more!


<br>
Week 3 - 🧙‍♀️ Building Decentralized Apps

In this section, we'll be going through SpeedRunEthereum!

SpeedRunEthereum is a set of challenges for developers to get building with Ethereum. It's not only about learning the syntax but also understanding what's possible with Ethereum. It's also a great way to build your web3 portfolio. You'll be writing code and deploying your smart contracts.

<br>
Week 4 - 🚢 Build Your Own Project

Now it's your turn to create your project!

It's all about building forkable components with Scaffold-ETH. You can make a new voting system component, work on the open issues, make a new challenge for SpeedRunEthereum, etc. Make sure to have a well-written README so anyone can easily set it up. Then, create your project & upload it to your BuidlGuidl Profile!

There's a lot you can build & collaborate with other builders in the ecosystem! That's where BuildGuild comes in! BuidlGuidl is a group of builders that build tools with Scaffold-ETH, meet and learn together, and get funded for contributing. The goal is to empower builders to create prototypes, projects and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem. 🌟 After building forkable Scaffold-ETH components, submitting them to your builder profile, and being active in the BuidlGuidl Telegram groups, you can get the opportunity to join BuidlGuidl!
